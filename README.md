### Pomodoro App

A pomodoro is a set of timers that help boost your productivity, doing 25 min of work, and then you can take either a 5 min break or a 15 min break

### What i learned

With this app i learned the basics of React Native, and how to setup the enviroment and make an app using Expo.

A little bit more about hook, specifically the useEffect

### Notes

I've made this project as part of a course of React Native, this is the first one of the 6 apps that are deloyed in that course

I've solved a bug of this pomodoro app that the original video has, it's a small fix anyways.
